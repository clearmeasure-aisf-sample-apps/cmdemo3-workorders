# Board Columns

The project board columns, in order:

- Conceptual Definition
- UX Design
- Technical Design
- Test Design
- Development
- Functional Testing
- UX Testing
- Release Queue
- Done

## Docs-only changes

A merge that changes only documentation publishes no release candidate. The factory moves such a card straight from Functional Testing to Done, because there is nothing to deploy or UX-test.

## Production incidents

When the health check reports unhealthy, the factory files a Production Incident into Release Queue and works it immediately.
