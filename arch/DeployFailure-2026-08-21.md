# Deploy Workflow Failure Window — 2026-08-21 (work item #9008)

## Summary

The Deploy GitHub Action failed repeatedly on master between 05:32Z and 15:08Z on
2026-08-21 (commits `9614eff0` through `6f577f22`), due to THREE distinct, unrelated
root causes that overlapped in the same time window. All three failure modes as
originally observed are fixed, and the Deploy workflow itself has run green on
every master run since 15:21Z (commit `2b66f8204a`), including current master
HEAD. **However**, live environment verification (see "Live probe correction"
below) found the mode-3 fix only masked the symptom rather than closing the
underlying gap: the Container App FQDN lookup still fails with `AuthorizationFailed`
(a service-principal RBAC issue), which silently skips the UAT/Prod health checks
rather than blocking the job. That gap, plus a related LlmGateway config gap, is
tracked as residual defects (#9011, #9016) and is not yet resolved.

## Historical Context (episode 21 of 21)

A separate full-history audit of the Deploy workflow (all 502 runs, 2026-02-22 to
2026-08-21, posted as issue #9008 comment
[5373938083](https://github.com/ClearMeasureLabs/bootcamp-palermo-workorders/issues/9008#issuecomment-5373938083))
found 289 completed master runs (207 green, 82 red) across 21 distinct green→red
episodes. Today's 05:32Z–15:08Z outage is **episode 21**, not the first Deploy
failure this project has had:

- The first-ever green→red was 2026-02-22 (TDD job, exit code 1); recovered same
  night.
- A separate, earlier episode today — **EP20, 01:16Z–01:54Z** — was an OctopusDeploy
  create-release-action error that recovered before EP21 (this window) began at
  05:32Z. EP20 is out of scope for this doc's `f68aad70..6f577f22` window.
- The longest-ever outage was **EP18**, 41 consecutive red runs over ~13 days
  (2026-07-16 to 07-29), caused by an invalid/rotated Octopus API key.
- Recurring themes across all 21 episodes: TDD acceptance-test failures (most
  common), Octopus service errors (503s, gateway timeouts, failed deploy tasks,
  release-version collisions — the same collision class seen as mode 2 below), and
  one GitHub environment approval-gate rejection.

The audit's summary of EP21 groups all 6 red runs under "TDD Run Acceptance tests"
with cached-Playwright-binary corruption as the cause and the Container App FQDN
error as secondary. Direct log inspection of each of the 6 failing runs (below,
via `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, re-verified against raw log text) shows EP21
is actually **three distinct proximate failure signatures**, not one: the
Playwright ARM64 cache corruption is real and is the cause of the very first red
run (`32450953882`), but the three middle reds (`dd8b6172`, `d1a35c2a`, `dd14d8fe`)
fail specifically on an Octopus release-version collision
(`Release '1.4.25xx' already exists`) inside the TDD job's Octopus release-creation
step — a different error class from the Playwright/browser-cache symptom, and
consistent with the "release-version collision" theme the historical audit calls
out as recurring across other episodes. The final two reds (`d96dd27d`, `6f577f22`)
show TDD passing (Playwright fixed) but UAT failing on the Container App FQDN
`AuthorizationFailed` lookup. This doc's per-run table and root-cause sections below
reflect the raw-log evidence; the mode numbering (1/2/3) is used consistently
throughout.

## Failure Window

- First failing run: `32450953882` (05:32:57Z, headSha `9614eff0`, TDD job)
- Last failing run: `32495982631` (15:08:30Z, headSha `6f577f22`, UAT job)
- Last known-good before the window: run `32447607246` (04:37:41Z, headSha `f68aad70`)
- First recovered run: `32497148168` (15:21:27Z, headSha `2b66f8204a`)

## Failing Deploy Runs on Master During the Window

| Run ID | Time (UTC) | headSha | Job / Failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32450953882 | 05:32:57Z | `9614eff0` | TDD job failed (mode 1: Playwright ARM64 cache) |
| 32452767476 | 06:01:51Z | `dd8b6172` | TDD/Octopus job failed (mode 2: Octopus version collision) |
| 32487627650 | 13:35:19Z | `d1a35c2a` | Octopus release job failed (mode 2 recurring) |
| 32489463066 | 13:56:11Z | `dd14d8fe` | Octopus release job failed (mode 2 recurring) |
| 32493694397 | 14:43:41Z | `d96dd27d` | UAT job failed (mode 3: Container App FQDN AuthorizationFailed) — TDD now passing, confirms mode 1 fixed |
| 32495982631 | 15:08:30Z | `6f577f22` | UAT job failed (mode 3 recurring) |

## Three Distinct Root-Cause Failure Modes

(Identified via `gh run view <id> --log-failed`)

### Mode 1 — TDD Playwright ARM64/x64 browser-cache mismatch

Error: `headless_shell: 1: Syntax error: "&" unexpected` when launching the cached
browser binary — a wrong-architecture binary was served from the Playwright browser
cache, causing `Microsoft.Playwright.TargetClosedException` during
`BlazorWasmWarmUp.ExecuteAsync()` / `ServerFixture.OneTimeSetUp()`, failing all 96
acceptance tests in the TDD job.

**Fixed by:** commit `f622d6a0` (PR #8996, "Fix Deploy Playwright cache restoring
ARM64 browsers on x64", merged as `d96dd27d`) — no ARM64 cache error appears in any
run after this commit.

### Mode 2 — Octopus release version collision

Error from the "Create Octopus Release" step: `Release '1.4.2540' already exists for
this project. Please use a different version, or look at using a mask to
auto-increment the number.` Root cause: version numbers under the `1.4.x` scheme
collided across separate CI runs creating releases faster than the auto-increment
mask could keep unique values clear.

**Fixed by:** commit `1ff3080f` ("Bump release major version from 1.4.x to 2.4.x") —
moving the major version series eliminated collisions with already-registered
`1.4.x` releases in Octopus. No version-collision error appears in any run after
this commit.

### Mode 3 — UAT/Prod Container App FQDN lookup failing the whole job

Error from the "Get Container App FQDN" step:
`ERROR: (AuthorizationFailed) The client '...' does not have authorization to
perform action 'Microsoft.App/containerApps/read' over scope
'.../resourceGroups/bootcamp-uat/.../containerApps/ui-gh'`, followed by
`Write-Error "Error: Could not retrieve container app FQDN"; exit 1` — the step
aborted the whole UAT job even though the underlying Octopus deployment had already
succeeded; the FQDN lookup was a non-essential diagnostic step wired as a hard gate.

**Fixed by:** commit `8268a930` (PR #9002, "Do not fail UAT/Prod on Azure Container
App FQDN lookup", merged as headSha `2b66f8204a` — the first green run) — the lookup
is now non-blocking since Octopus already gates real deploy success.

## Commit Classification, `f68aad70..6f577f22` (oldest to newest)

All commits not listed below are UNRELATED — pure test-coverage/hardening additions
in PRs #8975 (Worker coverage), #8976 (UI.Server/Api coverage), #8977
(LlmGateway/McpServer coverage), #8979 (Copilot test hardening), plus assorted
Qodana findings fixes — none touch Deploy workflow YAML or
Playwright/Octopus/Container-App configuration.

- `9614eff0` (PR #8977, LlmGateway/McpServer coverage) — UNRELATED to root cause;
  merely the first commit whose Deploy run exposed the pre-existing Playwright
  ARM64 cache bug (mode 1). Evidence: run `32450953882`.
- `dd8b6172`, `d1a35c2a`, `dd14d8fe` — headShas of runs that failed on the Octopus
  version collision (mode 2 recurring). UNRELATED as causes (the collision is an
  Octopus-side release-numbering issue, not introduced by these specific commits);
  each is evidence the bug was still present.
- `f622d6a0` (PR #8996) — FIXED mode 1 (Playwright ARM64 cache). Evidence: no ARM64
  cache failure in any run after `d96dd27d`.
- `d96dd27d`, `6f577f22` — headShas of runs where TDD passed (confirming mode 1
  fixed) but UAT failed on the FQDN AuthorizationFailed error (mode 3). Evidence:
  runs `32493694397` and `32495982631`.
- `1ff3080f` — FIXED mode 2 (Octopus version collision), by bumping major version
  1.4.x → 2.4.x.
- Commits after `6f577f22`, before first green run `2b66f8204a`: `8268a930`
  (PR #9002) — FIXED mode 3 (Container App FQDN AuthorizationFailed made
  non-blocking). This commit's merge (`2b66f8204a`) is the headSha of the first
  green Deploy run (`32497148168`, 15:21:27Z).
- `6adbc92d` (PR #9003, "Run Prod after UAT even when TDD was skipped") — landed
  AFTER the window closed (strictly after `2b66f8204a`, confirmed via
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor`). Follow-up hardening, not part of what fixed this
  incident; it addresses Prod-stage gating when TDD is skipped by path filters,
  unrelated to modes 1-3.
- "skipped" job conclusions seen throughout the window (e.g. UAT/Prod skipped when
  TDD fails) are the workflow's normal cascading stage-dependency gating (UAT only
  runs if TDD succeeds, Prod only if UAT succeeds) — expected behavior, not a
  defect.

## Verification of Current State

Current master HEAD (`60f1cf10`) Deploy run `32511996076`
(2026-08-21T18:10:45Z) is fully green — TDD: success, UAT: success, Prod: success
(confirmed via `gh run view 32511996076 --json jobs`). No fresh trigger or revert
was required; the window is fully closed with all three root causes fixed by
commits already on master (`f622d6a0`, `1ff3080f`, `8268a930`).

**Live probe correction (2026-08-21 ~19:00Z):** a direct `/_healthcheck` probe of all
three environments (independent of the Deploy workflow's own health-check step)
found the green run's status only partially trustworthy. All three environments do
serve the correct deployed image (`2.4.2589`) and are online. TDD is Healthy. UAT
and Prod are **Degraded** — the `LlmGateway` health check reports the
`AI_OpenAI_ApiKey` / `AI_OpenAI_Url` / `AI_OpenAI_Model` chat client as
unconfigured in those two environments (TDD has this configuration; UAT/Prod do
not). More significantly, run `32511996076`'s own logs show UAT and Prod were
**never actually health-checked at all**: both "Get Container App FQDN" steps
failed with `AuthorizationFailed` — the deploy service principal lacks
`Microsoft.App/containerApps/read` on `bootcamp-uat` and `bootcamp-prod` — and
`continue-on-error: true` on that step (added by the mode-3 fix, `8268a930`) left
`CONTAINER_APP_URL` empty, which the health-check step's
`if: env.CONTAINER_APP_URL != ''` guard then silently skipped. This corrects the
earlier hypothesis in #9011 (below) that the FQDN failures were purely a missing
repo-vars problem — the real gap is service-principal RBAC, not repo variable
configuration; #9011 has been updated with this correction. Separately, even TDD's
"blocking" health loop treats a `Degraded` response as passing by design
(`deploy.yml` ~226), so `Degraded` currently never blocks promotion anywhere in the
pipeline (tracked as #9017 below).

## Residual Defects

All 6 failing runs in the window are fully explained by the 3 root causes above,
and each root cause has a confirmed fixing commit whose merge coincides with or
precedes the run that stopped exhibiting that error — the failure *window itself*
is closed with no unexplained red run remaining.

However, a follow-up code review of the fixes that closed the window
(`deploy.yml` / `build.yml` / `.octopus/deployment_process.ocl`, posted as issue
#9008 comment
[5373961642](https://github.com/ClearMeasureLabs/bootcamp-palermo-workorders/issues/9008#issuecomment-5373961642))
found that several of the fixes muted symptoms rather than closing gaps, and
surfaced one latent bug of the same class as mode 1. Filed as child work items of
#9008 (leftmost board column), not fixed in this PR:

- **#9011** — UAT/Prod health checks are non-blocking (regression from the mode-3
  fix, commit `8268a930`): the FQDN lookup AND the health-check step are
  `continue-on-error: true`, so a crash-looping revision can promote to Prod with
  zero post-deploy verification. **Updated by live-probe correction** (comment on
  #9011): the FQDN failures are a service-principal RBAC gap
  (`Microsoft.App/containerApps/read` missing on `bootcamp-uat`/`bootcamp-prod`),
  not a repo-vars misconfiguration as first hypothesized — grant the role, then
  remove `continue-on-error` and make the health checks blocking.
- **#9012** — Prod gating weakened by the mode-3-adjacent commit `6adbc92d`: on
  `workflow_dispatch`, Prod can be reached with an unvalidated `release_number` and
  no test gate; also no concurrency group on the Prod job.
- **#9013** — the NuGet cache in `build.yml` has the same cross-architecture
  poisoning mechanism that caused mode 1 (Playwright), unfixed: ARM and x64 jobs
  share a restore-key prefix.
- **#9014** — misc CI hardening: `cancel-in-progress` silently drops superseded
  master Deploy runs, `.trx` upload lacks `if: always()`, SQL connection string is
  unmasked in logs, hardcoded `2.4.` version literal in `run-name`.
- **#9016** — UAT and Prod are currently serving Degraded (LlmGateway chat client
  unconfigured); configure `AI_OpenAI_ApiKey`/`AI_OpenAI_Url`/`AI_OpenAI_Model` in
  those environments or explicitly mark that health check optional there.
- **#9017** — decide whether a `Degraded` health response should gate promotion;
  currently it never does anywhere in the pipeline (`deploy.yml` ~226 treats
  `Degraded` as passing by design).

None of #9011–#9014, #9016, or #9017 block Deploy being green (in workflow-run
terms) today; they are hardening/defect work for the fixes already on master and
for the environment state uncovered by direct probing, scoped as separate PRs per
the discovered-work rule (this PR is the analysis/catalog deliverable only).
