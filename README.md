# Work Order Management System

A work order management application built with .NET 10.0 implementing Onion Architecture. The system uses Blazor WebAssembly for the UI, Entity Framework Core for data access, MediatR for CQRS, and deploys to Azure Container Apps.

This codebase serves as both a working application and a teaching reference for software architecture. The 51 architectural patterns cataloged below are all demonstrated in the source code.

## Getting Started

1. Install the .NET 10 SDK.
2. Run `dotnet build` from the repository root.
3. Run the AppHost project `src/ChurchBulletin.AppHost` to start the application.
4. Read `docs/glossary-ops.md` for the operations terms used on the board.
5. For a full local Bootcamp run, see [Quick start — Run locally](#quick-start--run-locally) below.

```

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- One of the following database options:
  - **Windows:** SQL Server LocalDB (included with Visual Studio)
  - **Linux/macOS with Docker:** SQL Server 2022 runs automatically in a container
  - **Linux/macOS without Docker:** SQLite (automatic fallback)
- [PowerShell 7+](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) (cross-platform, required for build scripts)
- [Playwright browsers](https://playwright.dev/) (for acceptance tests only)

## Build

```powershell
# Quick build (Windows)
.\build.bat

# Quick build (Linux/macOS)
./build.sh

# Full build — clean, compile, unit tests, DB migration, integration tests
. .\build.ps1 ; Build

# dotnet CLI directly
dotnet build src/ChurchBulletin.sln --configuration Release
```

## Run Tests

```powershell
# Unit tests
dotnet test src/UnitTests --configuration Release

# Integration tests
dotnet test src/IntegrationTests --configuration Release

# Acceptance tests (install Playwright browsers first)
pwsh src/AcceptanceTests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install
dotnet test src/AcceptanceTests --configuration Debug
```

## Quick start — Run locally

The repository supports three common local development workflows. Pick the one that matches your environment.

- Windows (Visual Studio / LocalDB)

  1. Open the solution in Visual Studio (ChurchBulletin.sln).
  2. Ensure LocalDB is available and your launch profile is configured.
  3. Run UI.Server from Visual Studio or:
     ```powershell
     cd src/UI/Server
     dotnet run
     ```
  Note: Visual Studio launch profiles may override ConnectionStrings in launchSettings.json. Use the Environment configuration below if you need to override.

- Linux / macOS (recommended with Docker)

  1. Start a SQL Server container:
     ```bash
     docker run --name churchbulletin-mssql \
       -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=churchbulletin-mssql#1A' \
       -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' \
       -p 1433:1433 \
       -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
     ```
  2. Set environment variables and run the server:
     ```bash
     export ConnectionStrings__SqlConnectionString="server=localhost,1433;database=ChurchBulletin;User ID=sa;Password=churchbulletin-mssql#1A;TrustServerCertificate=true;"
     export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
     # Must set APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING or set to an empty string to avoid the Azure Monitor exporter crashing:
     export APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=""
     # Prevent the app from attempting to contact Azure OpenAI (leave empty if not used)
     export AI_OpenAI_ApiKey=""
     export AI_OpenAI_Url=""
     export AI_OpenAI_Model=""
     cd src/UI/Server
     dotnet run --no-launch-profile --urls "https://localhost:7174;http://localhost:5174"
     ```
  Important: use `--no-launch-profile` on Linux/macOS to avoid the Windows LocalDB connection string from launchSettings.json overriding your env vars.

- SQLite fallback (no Docker)

  1. Set the database engine and run the build scripts:
     ```bash
     export DATABASE_ENGINE=SQLite
     cd src
     pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./PrivateBuild.ps1
     ```
  The build scripts will use SQLite when Docker is not available.

### Run locally with SQLite

Use this path when Docker is not available and you want to run the application (not just the build).

1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_ENGINE=SQLite
   export ConnectionStrings__SqlConnectionString=""
   ```
2. Seed reference data:
   ```bash
   dotnet test src/IntegrationTests --filter "ZDataLoader"
   ```
3. Run the UI:
   ```bash
   cd src/UI/Server
   dotnet run --no-launch-profile --urls "https://localhost:7174;http://localhost:5174"
   ```

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full environment-variable reference.

Health and URLs
- The application starts at https://localhost:7174 by default.
- Health check endpoint: https://localhost:7174/_healthcheck

Architecture diagrams
- See the arch/ folder for PlantUML sources and rendered images. The architecture docs (arch/README.md) explain rendering and icon configuration.
- To regenerate PlantUML images locally: use the helper scripts:
  - PowerShell: pwsh arch/render-diagrams.ps1
  - Bash: ./arch/render-diagrams.sh
- A CI job (.github/workflows/render-diagrams.yml) validates that diagram images are kept in sync on pull requests.
- To install the optional pre-commit hook that re-renders diagrams when .puml files are staged, run the repository setup script.
  - Bash (Linux/macOS/Git Bash): ./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
  - PowerShell (Windows): pwsh ./scripts/setup-dev-env.ps1

Playwright (acceptance tests)
- Install browsers (PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  pwsh src/AcceptanceTests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install
  ```
- Run acceptance tests:
  ```bash
  dotnet test src/AcceptanceTests --configuration Debug
  ```

gRPC (work orders)
- Protobuf contract: src/UI/Server/Protos/workorders.proto
- Generated C# (checked in): src/UI/Server/Generated/Protos/
- To regenerate the C# files after editing .proto, run the Grpc.Tools generation on an x64 machine and replace the checked-in generated files (Grpc.Tools can be unstable on ARM).

# Architecture Patterns Reference

A catalog of 51 architectural patterns and design concepts demonstrated in this codebase, annotated with authoritative reference URLs suitable for student learning.

---

## Domain & Application Architecture

### 1. Onion Architecture
Layered architecture where dependencies point inward. Inner layers define interfaces; outer layers implement them. Core has zero outward dependencies.
- **Reference:** [Jeffrey Palermo — The Onion Architecture, Part 1 (2008)](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)

### 2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separates read models (queries) from write models (commands), allowing each to be optimized independently.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — CQRS](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)

### 3. Mediator Pattern
A behavioral design pattern where a mediator object encapsulates how objects interact, promoting loose coupling. Implemented here via the MediatR library.
- **Reference:** [Refactoring Guru — Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator)

### 4. Domain Model
An object model of the business domain that incorporates both behavior and data. Business logic lives inside the domain objects themselves.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Domain Model (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html)

### 5. Layer Supertype (Entity Base Class)
An abstract base class that provides common behavior (identity, equality) for all domain entities in a layer.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Layer Supertype (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/layerSupertype.html)

### 6. Value Object
An immutable object defined entirely by its attributes rather than a unique identity. Two value objects with the same attributes are considered equal.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Value Object](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html)

### 7. Enumeration Class (Smart Enum)
Replaces primitive `enum` types with full classes that carry behavior, enabling richer domain modeling and avoiding primitive obsession.
- **Reference:** [Microsoft — Enumeration Classes over Enum Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/enumeration-classes-over-enum-types)

### 8. State Machine Pattern
Objects transition through a set of defined states via validated transitions, preventing invalid state changes.
- **Reference:** [Refactoring Guru — State Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)

### 9. Repository Pattern
Abstracts data access behind a collection-like interface, decoupling the domain from persistence technology. Implemented implicitly via EF Core's `DbContext`.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Repository (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html)

### 10. Unit of Work
Tracks all changes made during a business transaction and commits them as a single atomic operation. Implemented implicitly via EF Core's `SaveChanges`.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Unit of Work (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html)

---

## Dependency Management & Wiring

### 11. Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control
Components declare their dependencies through constructor parameters; an external container resolves and provides them at runtime.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)

### 12. Service Registry
A well-known object that other objects use to find common services. Centralized registration of services in a single registry class.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Registry (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/registry.html)

### 13. Convention over Configuration
The framework automatically discovers and registers services by scanning assemblies, reducing explicit configuration in favor of naming and structural conventions.
- **Reference:** [Wikipedia — Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)

---

## UI & Presentation Architecture

### 14. Blazor WebAssembly (Client-Side SPA)

- **Reference:** [Microsoft Learn — ASP.NET Core Blazor Hosting Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models)

### 15. Server-Side Rendering with Client Hydration
Initial rendering occurs on the server for fast first paint; the client-side framework then takes over for interactivity.
- **Reference:** [Microsoft Learn — ASP.NET Core Blazor Render Modes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes)

### 16. Backend for Frontend (BFF)
A dedicated API layer tailored to the needs of a specific frontend, rather than a generic API serving all consumers.
- **Reference:** [Azure Architecture Center — Backends for Frontends Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends)

### 17. Shared Kernel
A shared set of types and interfaces used across bounded contexts or UI boundaries, maintained as a single shared project.
