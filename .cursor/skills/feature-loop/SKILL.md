  Run the feature loop on ONE GitHub work item in this repo: drive it across the
  ClearMeasureLabs project board (https://github.com/orgs/ClearMeasureLabs/projects/1)
  one column at a time — design, implement, verify — through code, tests, a conflict-free
  PR, API-verified green CI, bot-finding triage, merge, and board moves. Use when asked to
  "run the feature loop on work item #N", "work issue #N through the board", or when
  /feature-loop N is invoked. For a batch of items, use feature-loop-dispatch instead.

# Feature Loop (single work item) — Cursor

Drives exactly one work item end-to-end. Configuration (board, columns, build commands,
merge policy, cached board IDs) comes from `.claude/factory-loop.json` at the repo root
(shared with the Claude skill). These rules are the contract for this repository; a user's
own global rules may add to but never weaken them.

**Canonical contract:** Keep gates identical to `.claude/skills/feature-loop/SKILL.md`.
This file is the Cursor tool mapping only — when Claude gains a new gate, copy it here
unchanged (except Agent → Task wording).

**Before acting:** Read this file fully, then read `.claude/factory-loop.json`.

## Children first, depth-first (before touching the item)

Resolve `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{N}/sub_issues` BEFORE touching #N. Recurse to
the deepest open descendant and work the tree bottom-up: a child is driven to Done, then
its parent is reconsidered. A parent is never started while any of its descendants are
open. Independent siblings may be worked in parallel — each in its own Task worktree.
Report the resolved tree and execution order before starting.

## Roles (item coordinator vs column worker)

Two Task roles — do not conflate them:

| Role | Who | Scope |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Item coordinator** | The agent running this skill (or the one Task dispatched per item by feature-loop-dispatch) | Drives #N **end-to-end**: resolve children, advance one column at a time, verify each column, open PR, wait on CI, triage bots, merge, move card. May spawn column workers. |
| **Column worker** | A Task the coordinator spawns for one board column | Does **only that column's** design/implement/verify work (or a recorded no-op). Never advances other columns. |

`factory-loop.json` has `"subagentPerColumn": true`. The coordinator must not personally
perform writing work across multiple columns; it spawns a fresh column worker per column
(one delegation hop). Column workers never re-delegate.

## Column progression

- **One column at a time.** The item advances exactly one board column per transition —
  never skips — and only after that column's work is verified. Columns and their roles
  (design / implement / verify / terminal) are in `factory-loop.json`.
- **Independent Task per column.** Each column's work is done by its own dedicated column
  worker Task; one column's deliverable is the next column's input.
- Non-applicable columns are passed through with a recorded no-op justification (an issue
  comment stating why the column does not apply).
- On completion of the loop's scope, leave the card in `doneForNowColumn` from
  `factory-loop.json` unless the item is genuinely Done.

## Cursor Task / subagent rules

Use the **Task** tool (not Claude's Agent tool):

| Intent | Task parameters |
|--------|-----------------|
| Column worker / writing / build / test | `subagent_type: "best-of-n-runner"` (isolated git worktree); launch **exactly one** runner per column (never N competing attempts of the same column) |
| Read-only search | `subagent_type: "explore"` on the main checkout |
| Model | `inherit` (Auto, cost-optimized). Omit a named model unless the user explicitly named a listed slug. |
| Parallel independent children | `run_in_background: true`; cap at 3 writing Tasks |
| Nudge a stalled worker | `resume` with the prior Task agent id (replaces Claude SendMessage) |

- **One worktree per writing Task.** Parallel writing Tasks never share a checkout.
- Do not use `subagent_type: "claude"` — that is not a Cursor Task type.
- At most one delegation hop below the item coordinator (column workers must DO work, not
  re-delegate).

## Build, PR, and merge gates

- Branch naming: `{username}/{branch-description}` (account that initiated the session).
  When a Cloud Agent session mandates a different template (e.g. `cursor/...-xxxx`), use
  that template for branches created in that session.
- **Private build before commit:** `pwsh -NoProfile ./PrivateBuild.ps1` must pass.
- **Acceptance tests before PR:** `pwsh -NoProfile ./AcceptanceTests.ps1`.
- **Merge master before PR (mandatory):** before pushing or opening/updating a PR, fetch
  and merge `origin/master` into the branch, resolve conflicts, and re-run the private
  build. PRs must arrive conflict-free against current master.
- **Open/update PRs:** Cloud Agents use the **ManagePullRequest** tool (`create_pr` /
  `update_pr`). Local agents may use `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit` when write-enabled.
  `gh` is read-only in some Cloud Agent environments — never assume write works; on
  permission failure, report the blocked command and continue closeout as far as reads
  allow.
- **CI is API-verified only:** after pushing, poll
  `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs` and confirm EVERY job's
  `conclusion` is `success`. Never report a PR complete on "PR created" or a local build,
  and never infer status from a shell exit code. Fix and re-push until green.
- **Triage every bot review finding before merge:** follow the `bot-finding-triage` skill
  when available. List review comments from static-analysis bots
  (`github-code-quality[bot]`, `github-advanced-security[bot]`, etc.). Every finding is
  either fixed in the same PR or explicitly declined with a one-line reply on the PR.
  Never merge past bot findings silently.
- **Merge:** `gh pr merge` when write-enabled; merge method and issue-close policy come
  from `factory-loop.json`. If merge is blocked, leave a clear GREEN_UNMERGED status for
  the orchestrator/human — do not fake completion.

## Testing policy (definition of done, non-negotiable)

No functionality is added or changed without automated tests **in the same PR** at every
applicable layer:

1. **Unit tests** (`src/UnitTests` — NUnit 4.x + Shouldly, bUnit for components, AutoBogus
   for data; test doubles prefixed `Stub`).
2. **Integration tests** (`src/IntegrationTests`) wherever the change crosses a module
   boundary (data store, MediatR handlers, HTTP endpoints, cross-project calls).
3. **Full-system tests** (`src/AcceptanceTests` — Playwright, driving the real UI with
   third-party interfaces stubbed).

If a layer genuinely does not apply, state explicitly in the PR description why. UI
features MUST have a Playwright test that actually drives that UI. Respect the Onion
Architecture dependency rules (see repo `CLAUDE.md`) — violations are auto-rejected.

## Discovered work becomes a child

When working #N spawns new work — a follow-up from testing, a defect found while
implementing, a deferred bot finding — create it as a **child sub-issue** of #N, never a
free-floating sibling, and place it in the leftmost board column:

```
child_id=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{child} --jq .id)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{N}/sub_issues -X POST -F sub_issue_id=$child_id
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{N}/sub_issues   # verify
```

Note: the POST takes the child's numeric `id`, NOT its issue number.

## Parent clamp

A parent's board status may never be further right than the LEAST-advanced of its open
children. Before every parent card move, list the parent's sub-issues and clamp:
`parent_status = min(intended_status, min(status of each open child))`. A parent cannot
reach Done while any child is open; filing a follow-up child from a late column pulls the
parent BACK to the child's column (reopening it if closed). Record each clamp as a comment
on the parent naming the child that caused it. The parent advances again only as its
children advance.

## GitHub API budget

The GraphQL budget is shared across all agents. Use REST (`gh issue`, `gh pr`,
`gh api repos/...`) for reads and comments. Reserve GraphQL for board field mutations,
using the pre-cached IDs in `factory-loop.json` `boardIds` — re-fetch them only if a
mutation fails with an unknown-ID error. Check `gh api rate_limit` before any fan-out.

Card moves use:

```
gh api graphql -f query='mutation{updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input:{projectId:"<projectId>",itemId:"<itemId>",fieldId:"<statusFieldId>",value:{singleSelectOptionId:"<optionId>"}}){projectV2Item{id}}}'
```

(Find `itemId` for an issue via the org project: it is the ProjectV2 item ID, not the
issue node ID.)

## Anti-stall (single-item)

1. NO DISPATCHER CHAINS — a Task spawned for column work must DO the work, never merely
   re-delegate; at most one hop below the item coordinator.
2. SYNCHRONOUS FINISH — once CI is green, do bot triage, merge, issue close, and card
   move in the SAME turn; never end a turn between "CI green" and "merged".
3. When waiting on CI, use a bounded poll (Shell / AwaitShell) and after EVERY resumption
   re-check PR state with `gh` before assuming anything.
4. If any `gh` or ManagePullRequest call is blocked, report the exact command and error
   in the final message — do not stop silently.
5. Every wait needs a deadline: if no observable progress in 20 minutes, stop waiting,
   check state directly, and either take over or report the blockage.

## Completion heartbeat (mandatory — never hand off while pending)

The item coordinator MUST NOT end a turn or send a final message while CI, merge, issue
close, or card move is still pending.

When CI is running, poll every **60–90 seconds** until every check-run on the PR head (and,
after merge, on `origin/master` tip) has `conclusion` `success` or `skipped`:

```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs \
  --jq '[.check_runs[] | select(.status != "completed" or (.conclusion != "success" and .conclusion != "skipped")) | {name, status, conclusion}]'
```

Forbidden final states: "CI still running", "in progress", "will follow up", "monitoring".
Keep polling and finishing closeout in the same session.

The final message MUST begin with **`STATUS: COMPLETE`** or **`STATUS: BLOCKED`**, then
final board column, PR number, merge commit SHA, and any children created — only after
independent API verification of green CI on the merge commit.

## Reporting

Every status update states, in order: what happened, what it means for the work item, and
what happens next — plain software-team vocabulary (work item, defect, pull request,
build, automated tests, board status), no orchestration jargon. Finish with: final board
column, PR number, merge commit SHA, and any children created.
