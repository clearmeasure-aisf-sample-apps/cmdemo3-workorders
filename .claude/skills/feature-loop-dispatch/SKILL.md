  Authorize a batch of work items for full autonomous implementation in this repo

  computes a children-first execution order, and dispatches one dedicated sub-session
  (subagent) per work item that runs the /feature-loop skill end-to-end — code, tests,

  https://github.com/orgs/ClearMeasureLabs/projects/1 — with epic clamp rules enforced.
  Use when asked to "dispatch the feature loop on ...", "implement these work items", or

# Feature-Loop Dispatch

You are the **orchestrator**. The user has authorized the listed work items for full,
unattended implementation. From this point the session runs to completion without asking
anything further — every decision is made autonomously under the rules below.

The per-item rules are defined by this repo's `/feature-loop` skill
(`.claude/skills/feature-loop/SKILL.md`) and `.claude/factory-loop.json`. Those two files
are the contract; a user's own global rules may add to but never weaken them.

**Cursor:** use `.cursor/skills/feature-loop-dispatch/SKILL.md` (Task / `resume` /
stall heartbeat via AwaitShell) instead of this Claude Agent-oriented file when running
in Cursor.

## Phase 0 — Start the stall watchdog (before any dispatch)

Sub-sessions stall silently: they spawn a background CI poller and end their turn, and the
poller's completion notification routes to whoever is listening (often the orchestrator,
not the stopped lane) — so a PR can sit fully green and unmerged for hours. Detection must
therefore be EXTERNAL and MECHANICAL, never dependent on the stalled agent itself:

1. Run `pwsh -NoProfile .claude/skills/feature-loop-dispatch/Check-StalledLanes.ps1
   -Repo ClearMeasureLabs/bootcamp-palermo-workorders` once now to baseline (read-only,
   REST-only; exit 2 = stalls found).
2. Run it as a HEARTBEAT, not an alarm: launch a background command that sleeps ~15
   minutes, runs ONE check (pass `-TasksDir <session tasks dir>` so pre-PR local stalls
   are caught via output-file staleness), and EXITS UNCONDITIONALLY — its exit wakes you
   every cycle regardless of findings. RE-ARM IT AT THE END OF EVERY TURN in which it
   fired. An alarm that only fires on detected trouble misses undetectable trouble (local
   builds, harness runs, agents waiting on dead background tasks); a heartbeat guarantees
   an orchestrator wake-up with fresh eyes each cycle. NEVER wait open-ended on lane
   notifications alone.
3. For every stall it reports, act immediately:
   - `GREEN_UNMERGED` → SendMessage the owning lane: "PR #N is green; triage bots, merge,
     move card, report." If the lane is unresumable, do the merge-side finish yourself
     (verify check-runs, triage/reply bot findings, merge, card move) or spawn a fresh
     closer subagent.
   - `DIRTY` → order (or spawn) a conflict-resolution pass: merge master into the branch,
     rebuild, re-push, re-verify.
   - `CI_FAILED` / `CI_STUCK` → order a fix-and-repush or re-trigger.
   - `MERGED_ISSUE_OPEN` → close the issue yourself with the merge-evidence comment
     (verify sub_issues first; an issue clamped open behind open children is NOT a stall).

## Communication standard (applies to every update, issue comment, and PR description)

Write like a software delivery leader briefing a stakeholder: Clarity first. Plain
software-team vocabulary only — work item, defect, pull request, build, automated tests,
test run, board status, dependency. Never invent orchestration jargon. Specifically:

- Don't say "evidence PR" — say "a pull request that commits the test-run results
  (logs/output) to the repository."
- Don't say "clamp / clamped" — say "the parent work item stays open and its board status
  moves back to match its least-finished open sub-item" (the rule itself is unchanged;
  only the wording is).
- Don't say "lane," "loop," "chain," or agent IDs in user-facing updates — say "the work
  on item #N."
- Don't say "blocks #N's passing evidence" — say "defect #X must be fixed before we can
  re-run the tests and show item #N working."
- Every status update states, in order: what happened, what it means for the work item,
  and what happens next. A reader who has not followed the session must understand it
  cold.

## Inputs

The argument is a list of GitHub issue numbers (the "authorized set"). If no argument is
given, ask once for the list before starting; that is the only permitted question.

Configuration comes from the repo's `.claude/factory-loop.json` (tracker, project, column
map, private build command, merge method, cached board IDs).

## Phase 1 — Resolve the tree (before any work)

1. `gh api rate_limit --jq .resources` — record the budget. Board IDs (project ID, Status
   field ID, Status option IDs) are pre-cached in `factory-loop.json` `boardIds` — use
   them for every card move this session. Re-fetch via GraphQL
   (`organization(login:"ClearMeasureLabs"){projectV2(number:1){...}}`) ONLY if a
   mutation fails with an unknown-ID error, and update `factory-loop.json` when you do.
   All other reads/writes use REST.
2. For every authorized item, recursively resolve
   `gh api repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/sub_issues` to the deepest descendant. The full tree
   of every authorized item joins the work set — authorizing an epic authorizes its open
   descendants.
3. Build the execution order:
   - **Children first, depth-first.** A parent/epic enters the dispatch queue only after
     ALL of its open descendants are Done.
   - Open leaf items (no open children) are the initial dispatch wave.
   - Independent items (no shared ancestor-ordering constraint between them) run in
     parallel; explicitly ordered chains run sequentially.
4. Post the resolved tree and planned order as a comment on each authorized top-level
   item, and print it in the session before dispatching.

## Phase 2 — Dispatch one sub-session per work item

For each work item whose turn has arrived, launch **one dedicated subagent** (its own
session) via the Agent tool:

- `subagent_type: "claude"` (general, full tools), `model: "sonnet"` — never Haiku.
- `isolation: "worktree"` — every writing sub-session gets its own git worktree. No two
  sub-sessions ever share a checkout.
- Run in the background so independent items proceed concurrently. Cap concurrency at 3
  writing sub-sessions to protect the GitHub API budget and local build resources.

The subagent's prompt must instruct it to **run the feature loop on exactly that one work
item**, including verbatim:

> Run the feature loop on work item #N in ClearMeasureLabs/bootcamp-palermo-workorders.
> Follow this repo's `.claude/skills/feature-loop/SKILL.md` and
> `.claude/factory-loop.json` exactly: work in your own worktree from origin/master; one
> board column at a time via a fresh perspective per column (design → implement →
> verify), never skipping columns, recording no-op justifications for non-applicable
> columns; merge origin/master into the branch and re-run the private build
> (`pwsh -NoProfile ./PrivateBuild.ps1`) before any push or PR; run
> `pwsh -NoProfile ./AcceptanceTests.ps1` before opening the PR; triage every bot review
> finding (fix or explicitly decline with a PR reply) before merge; a PR is complete only
> when every check-run `conclusion` is `success` via
> `gh api repos/{o}/{r}/commits/{sha}/check-runs` — never a shell exit code; follow the
> Testing Policy (unit + integration + full-system Playwright in the same PR, or an
> explicit stated reason a layer doesn't apply). Use REST for all reads/comments; use
> only the cached board IDs from `.claude/factory-loop.json` for card moves. Any
> discovered follow-up work becomes a CHILD sub-issue of #N (POST the child's numeric id
> to `repos/{o}/{r}/issues/N/sub_issues`), placed in the leftmost column — report every
> child you create in your final summary. When #N is merged and CI-verified green, move
> its card to the `doneForNowColumn` from factory-loop.json and report: final board
> column, PR number, merge commit SHA, and any children created.

**Anti-stall requirements — add these to every sub-session prompt verbatim:**

> ANTI-STALL RULES (mandatory): (1) NO DISPATCHER CHAINS — you may spawn subagents for
> column work, but a subagent you spawn must DO work, never merely re-delegate to another
> subagent; at most one delegation hop below you. (2) SYNCHRONOUS FINISH — once CI is
> green, do the bot-finding triage, merge, issue close, and card move in the SAME turn;
> never end your turn between "CI green" and "merged". (3) When waiting on CI, poll with
> a bounded foreground loop or a background task you own, and after EVERY resumption
> re-check the PR state directly with `gh` before assuming anything. (4) If any gh call
> is blocked by a permission hook or classifier, do not stop silently — report the exact
> blocked command and error in your final message so the orchestrator can act. (5) If
> your worktree becomes unusable, report it immediately rather than improvising outside
> it. (6) Every wait must have a deadline: if a subagent or CI run you're waiting on has
> made no observable progress in 20 minutes, stop waiting, check state directly, and
> either take over the work yourself or report the blockage.

## Phase 3 — Epic clamp and promotion (orchestrator's job, after every completion)

When a sub-session reports completion:

1. Verify its claims independently: check-runs green on the merge commit, card in the
   reported column. Never take a subagent's word for CI.
2. **New children discovered** by the sub-session join the work set immediately, are
   dispatched under the same rules, and clamp their parent (below).
3. **Clamp every affected ancestor:** for each ancestor of the completed/changed item,
   set `ancestor_status = min(intended_status, min(status of each open child))`. An
   ancestor is never in a more senior (further right) column than its least-advanced open
   child, is pulled BACK (and reopened if closed) when a child appears behind it, and
   each clamp is recorded as a comment on the ancestor naming the child that caused it.
4. **Promote epics only by clamp release:** when the last open child of an epic reaches
   Done, advance the epic one column at a time — each column transition performed by its
   own dedicated subagent per the column rules (a no-op justification pass is still a
   pass) — until it too is Done. An epic never advances in the same action that closed
   its child.
5. Dispatch the next queued item(s) whose prerequisites are now met.

## Phase 4 — Walk-away completion

The orchestrator loop continues until every item in the (grown) work set is Done or hard-
blocked. Do not stop because the session is long; use background subagents and wait for
their notifications — but NEVER wait on notifications alone: keep the Phase 0 watchdog
running on its ≤15-minute cadence for the whole session, because a completed grandchild's
notification may route to you instead of its stopped parent lane, leaving that lane
permanently asleep. When a notification arrives from a grandchild (an agent you did not
spawn), relay its result to the owning lane via SendMessage yourself — do not assume the
lane saw it. If a sub-session fails, read its output, fix the dispatch (new
subagent, corrected prompt, or a filed child defect), and continue — a local build
failure is diagnosed to root cause, never dismissed as environmental.

**Phase 4 does not authorize ending the session.** Walk-away means the user does not need
to answer questions — not that the orchestrator may stop while work is still pending.
Session termination requires Phase 5 verification first.

## Phase 5 — Completion heartbeat (mandatory — never hand off while pending)

The orchestrator MUST NOT end a turn — and MUST NOT send a final user-facing message —
while ANY of the following remain unresolved:

- Any authorized work item not verified Done (issue closed, or explicitly hard-blocked with
  reason recorded on the issue)
- Any PR for the work set still open and unmerged
- Any CI check-run with `status != "completed"`, or `conclusion` not in (`success`,
  `skipped`)
- Any dispatched sub-session whose outcome has not been independently verified
- Any merge to master whose tip commit has not been API-verified green

### Forbidden terminal messages

Never end the session with status equivalent to:

- "CI is still running" / "checks in progress" / "waiting on CI"
- "In progress" / "monitoring" / "will follow up" / "polling started"
- A partial summary that leaves verification unfinished

If CI, merges, or sub-sessions are pending, **keep working** — poll, SendMessage, merge,
or fix — until Phase 5 exit criteria are met or a hard block is documented.

### CI polling heartbeat (60–90 seconds)

Whenever CI is pending on a PR head SHA or a post-merge master tip SHA:

1. Poll every **60–90 seconds** (foreground sleep loop or background task that exits when
   done). Example:

   ```
   gh api repos/ClearMeasureLabs/bootcamp-palermo-workorders/commits/{sha}/check-runs \
     --jq '[.check_runs[] | select(.status != "completed" or (.conclusion != "success" and .conclusion != "skipped")) | {name, status, conclusion}]'
   ```

2. An empty `[]` result means CI is complete for that SHA. Non-empty means keep polling.
3. After every merge, poll **`origin/master` tip SHA** until all check-runs are green.
   Merge alone is not Done.
4. On CI failure, act in the same session (fix, re-push, or spawn a closer subagent) — do
   not report Done and leave red CI running.

Phase 0's ~15-minute stall watchdog and Phase 5's ~75-second CI poll **both** run for the
whole session. Phase 5 prevents the gap where a turn ends with "CI running" between
watchdog cycles.

### Session-end gate (independent verification)

Before the ONLY permitted final message, verify ALL of:

- [ ] Every work item: closed, or hard-blocked with documented reason
- [ ] Every PR: merged (or documented why merge was impossible)
- [ ] Every relevant merge commit / master tip: all check-runs `success` or `skipped` via
  the check-runs API — never shell exit codes, never subagent claims
- [ ] `Check-StalledLanes.ps1` baseline: no `GREEN_UNMERGED`, `CI_STUCK`, or `CI_FAILED`
  for the work set

The final message MUST begin with **`STATUS: COMPLETE`** or **`STATUS: BLOCKED`** (with
the exact blocker). Then: per item — final column, PR, merge SHA, children created (and
outcomes), plus any item left blocked and exactly why.

## Hard rules (restated, non-negotiable)

- One subagent = one work item's current column step; no subagent carries an item across
  multiple columns, and the orchestrator itself never edits code.
- Every writing subagent: Sonnet + own worktree.
- A parent never outranks its least-advanced open child on the board.
- CI is verified via the check-runs API only.
- REST-first; cached board IDs from `factory-loop.json`; check `rate_limit` before each
  dispatch wave.
